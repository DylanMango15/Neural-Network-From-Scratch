# **Neural-Network-From-Scratch**
### **An introduction to neural networks for beginners and a walkthrough of creating a neural network from scratch in python**

Hey there! Welcome to my beginner neural networks tutorial. In this notebook we will briefly explain the basics of neural networks, and work through building our own image classification network from scratch.

We will be using the **MNIST dataset**, a set of 60,000 labelled 28x28 images of handwritten digits. This is a very famous data set in machine learning and is often used in beginner tutorials, so it's perfect for us to use here. You can download it from my drive [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DJrG8Hgo3qPMWud_GAIY0k_uf2RGmTvy/view?usp=drive_link) or from a million and one places online. This notebook is designed to be beginner friendly, so you don't need any prior experience to engage with it.

I made this project as I am currently studing artificial intelligence in my degree, and I decided this would be a great way to really consolidate and test my understanding of the basic, core principals underpinning machine learning neural nets. I encourage anybody who reads through this notebook to take a stab at making your own network, or perhaps editing my code to experiment with different parameters.

I hope you enjoy this guide and learn a thing or two :)
